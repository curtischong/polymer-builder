# polymer-builder

demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pXFkg114ek

Note: the "stretching" in the video is NOT realistic. I built it so ppl can criticize the method. However, I do believe that the technique used to generate the polymer is good.

In the future, we can have realtime MD so we can drag these polymers around like a ragdoll and attach cross link bonds between polymer chains.

### how to use the viewer

go into viewer, then run these commands:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
then go into http://localhost:3000/ on your browser!


### How to generate the polymer:
